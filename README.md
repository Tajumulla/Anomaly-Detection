# Anomaly-Detection
Detecting the Anomaly in Transaction Data

  Anomaly detection in transaction data acts like a vigilant watchdog, sniffing out suspicious activity amidst the flurry of financial exchanges. Think of it as scanning a bustling marketplace, instantly spotting a counterfeit bill amid genuine ones. By analyzing patterns and deviations, it flags unusual transactions that could indicate fraud, errors, or even money laundering, keeping your financial life safe and sound.
  
Exploration:

1. Data overview: The code initially analyzes the data using pandas functions like head(), isnull().sum(), info(), and describe() to understand the general statistics, missing values, and data types.

2. Visualization: Histograms are generated for key features like "Transaction_Amount", "Frequency_of_Transactions", and "Average_Transaction_Amount" to visualize the distribution of values. Boxplots are also used to compare transaction amounts across different variables like "Day_of_Week", "Time_of_Day", and "Account_Type".

3. Correlations: A heatmap is generated using sns.heatmap to visualize the correlation between numerical features like income and transaction-related variables, providing insights into potential relationships.

Unmasking Anomalies with the Isolation Forest:

1. Thresholding the Unordinary: I have calculated the mean and standard deviation of "Transaction_Amount". Two standard deviations above the mean becomes our threshold, marking any value exceeding it as a potential anomaly. This sets the stage for identifying transactions that deviate significantly from the "normal" patterns.

2. Visualizing the Outliers: A scatter plot takes center stage, highlighting anomalies in "Transaction_Amount" using color coding. This visual representation makes it easy to spot suspicious transactions that stand out from the crowd.

3. The Isolation Forest Rises: Enter the Isolation Forest, a powerful anomaly detection algorithm. This model excels at isolating anomalies by randomly splitting the data and measuring the depth of each data point's isolation. Anomalies tend to be easily isolated, requiring fewer splits than normal data points. By analyzing these isolation paths, the model learns to identify anomalies with remarkable accuracy.

4. Putting the Model to the Test: The trained Isolation Forest is evaluated on a test set, facing a battery of challenges to assess its ability to distinguish anomalies from normal transactions. A classification report reveals the model's performance, providing valuable insights into its strengths and areas for potential improvement.

5. Predicting for You: The code empowers to take an active role in anomaly detection. By entering values for relevant features like transaction amount, average amount, and frequency, we can leverage the trained model to predict whether the transaction is likely an anomaly. This personalized approach makes anomaly detection accessible and actionable.
